# Desktop Carousel

### How to Run

In your Microsoft Code, make sure you install Live Server from Extensions.

After you have cloned the project, in the root directory, right click on index.html and click 
'run with Live Server'.

You should see a url:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
```

### Aim of the project

Create a web page that acts as a daily desktop for the news and events I am interested in.
It should showcase:

- Using table and animation to show Covid-19 data on cases and deaths by country (done)
- Using a circular linked list, scroll through an image every hour (done)
- Shows the current Shenzhen weather (done)
- Draggable to-do list

My goal is to use as much javascript and DOM as I can. Once this project is done, I will have completed es5 & es6 portion of my GROW.
