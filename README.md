### Aim of the project

Create a web page that acts as a daily desktop for the news and events I am interested in.
It should showcase:

- Using table and animation to show Covid-19 data on cases and deaths by country (done)
- Using a circular linked list, scroll through an image every hour (done)
- Shows the current Shenzhen weather (done)
- Draggable to-do list

My goal is to use as much javascript and DOM as I can. Once this project is done, I will have completed es5 & es6 portion of my GROW.
